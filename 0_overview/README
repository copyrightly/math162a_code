Brandeis Math 162a: Code Examples
Unit 0: Overview of Scientific Computing 
========================================
acc_test.py - a program to test the value of machine epsilon, by comparing
how small a value of h is needed before 1+h evaluates to the same as 1.

acc_test.cc - a version of acc_test.py written in C++. With the GNU C++
compiler, the program can be compiled with "g++ -o acc_test acc_test.cc" and
then run with "./acc_test". It finds the same value of h as the Python
version, emphasizing that what is being tested is due to the hardware-level
implementation of floating point arithmetic, as opposed to being due to the
specific programming language. 

The lectures also discussed paranoia.c, originally written by Prof. William
Kahan (UC Berkeley), available here:

This C program performs a number of tests to ensure that the computer's
arithmetic system does not have any errors.
